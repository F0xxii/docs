# Welcome!

Welcome to the Ripple Documentation. This uses a slightly more advanced system than the one on the [website](http://new.ripple.moe/doc), and is used mainly for documents for those digging really deep into Ripple, or just developers who want to look at the API docs. The Ripple API allows developers to interact with Ripple itself, being able to fetch data like an user's stats and all sorts of cool stuff. Basically, it allows cool people to do cool things.

Anyway, if you're just looking around, or you're a developer and looking for making your documentation, welcome! And enjoy your "stay".
